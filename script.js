// PSEUDO CODE

// 1) landing page will have good branding, moving background, and buttons to send you to the predictor page, the results for nfl players page, the comparison page, or the video page

// 2) the predictor page will take user input for their height, weight, and at least one of their 10 and 20 yard split.
// - that data will be stored in global variables and used to plug into a function to predict the time of their 40
// - that time will be used to compare to all of the pros (or a select number based on filters by position or year) and return a value (#/##);
// - that prediction and comparison will be shown on the screen






// predict formula using 10 yard and BW

// if (athlete body weight is < 200lbs) {
//   40 = 10yd split + 2.8-3.0
// } else if (ath bw is >= 200 && ath bw is < 250 ) {
//   40 = 10 yd + 3.0 - 3.2
// } else if (ath bw is >= 250 && ath bw is <= 325) {
//   40 = 10 yd + 3.2 - 3.4
// } else {
//   40 = 10 yd + 4
// }
